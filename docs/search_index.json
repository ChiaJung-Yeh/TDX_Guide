Spatial analysis is vital in terms of transportation study. For instance, when conducting the transport planning analysis, we need to collect the data of the study area, and dig into the issue about geographic characteristic, socioeconomic factors, to further do research on the traffic zone, trip distribution and so forth. Here we need the skills of spatial analysis before executing the transport planning process. In fact, there are more powerful and more user-experience based tools such as ArcGIS, CUBE and many other transport planning software to do spatial analysis. However, these software are not easily accessible due to high-cost. Hence, we can use R to do some simple spatial analysis instead. In the notebook, we would acquire the skills listed below. Making customized maps. Join the spatial and attribute data. Conduct spatial operations. Data analysis on spatial data. Export our own spatial data. In addition, the notebook would focus on the transportation spatial issue. If you are major in Transportation Engineering or Transportation Management, you may relate to the content. The notebook provides lots of example regarding transportation data in Taiwan. Any suggestions and questions please contact here. "]]
